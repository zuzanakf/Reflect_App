Reflect is a Streamlit-based application designed to guide users on a journey of emotional self-discovery. 
Sometimes it is difficult to ask yourself the right questions to understand your emotional reactions.
Through a series of interactive questions posed by our AI chatbot, Reflect encourages users to delve deeper 
into their feelings, identify their emotional triggers, and gain a better understanding of their reactions. 
Please note, Reflect is not a substitute for professional mental health services but can be a valuable tool in the pursuit of emotional understanding and personal growth.
